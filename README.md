# Text-Editor

## Description

- The purpose of this repository is for a developer to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
so that they can reliably retrieve them for later use.
- This is done by building a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the Progressive Web Applications (PWA) criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.
